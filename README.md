# ♪ deeJay ♫
deeJay is an easy-to-use Music Bot for Discord, written in Java using [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [Lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer).

You can compile this with Gradle and use it locally however you like, but if you're going to modify and re-publish or implement the source code in your own bot, please let me know in advance and give credit where it's due.

You need **Java 8** for this project to run.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me either in private, or in my public bot's guild.
